### Challenges Encountered
- Timer countdown decreasing by two. I decreased the time in the parameter instead of changing it in the setState function.
- Importing images. I search how to import the images and my file path was the error.

### Aha! Moments
- I now know how to use react bootsrap popover. I was amazed that there's also an api about automatically closing the popover. My first guest about that was to use state.
- I now know that I can use form radio buttons for selection of the items and I can easily highlight selected item instead of manually creating the logic of selecting and highlighting of selection.
